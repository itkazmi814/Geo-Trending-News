# Geo-Trending-News

NOTE: The main search functionality is currently broken and is a WIP. My main focus and contribution to this project was in the front end design and layout. This was developed in the beginning of my venture into development and is undergoing a complete overhaul.

Immediate Changes to be Implemented
* Move to React front end
* Implement Postgres for data storage
* Auth0 authentication
* Move to more stable news API implementation
